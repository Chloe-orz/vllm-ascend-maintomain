"""Shared bring-up for the LWD edge/cloud workers (worker layer only).

Both subclasses are selected by ``platform.py`` only for LWD deployments.
They diverge after ``init_device``: the edge hijacks ``execute_model`` for
embed/unembed direct calls (no runner forward, no KV cache), the cloud
delegates to a swapped-in ``LwdCloudModelRunner`` and owns the UP/DOWN
data plane. This base only owns what the two workers used to duplicate
verbatim: the data-plane channel handshake (after the native distributed
bring-up, which routes itself to the LWD layout when lwd_config is
present) plus the shared data-plane handle.
